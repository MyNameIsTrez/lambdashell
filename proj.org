* Methodology
** How bash does it (Thanks Freek!)
1. split on pipes
2. set environment variables found in the command (VAR=VALUE cmd)
3. set up the redirections (heredoc is part of that)
4. expand environment variables
5. parse the commands
6. check if it is built-in, if not find the executable, if so, run built-in
7. execute all commands at the same time (and if one doesn't expect input and the one that pipes into the non-expecting-input one tries to pipe into there, it should quit also (`cat | ls`))

* Documentation
** t_cmd
The t_cmd struct contains all data required to run execve.
** t_exec_element
